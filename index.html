    <h2><P><i>What are we doing to the ocean?: We are doing mass fishing and harming the marine wild life, for every one pound of fish that goes into the market tens or even hundreds of them are thrown back into the sea.
      <br>
      <br>
    We are using water bodies as dumping grounds and polluting the marine ecosytems and the aquatic habitats without thinking about how it will affect the marine life and even how it might affect us.
    <br>
    <br>

    We are emitting greenhouse gases through many of our daily activities, these green house gases are mostly absorbed by the water bodies and excess absorbtion of these green house gases leads to ocean acidification which affects the health and growth of the marine animals and the biotic components of the marine ecosystem.
    

    <br>
    <br>

    Marine animals (eg- Fish, prawns, crabs, sea urchins, etc.) are losing their homes and because of oil spills, many marine animals aren't able to breath and the fish bones and trash which is also thrown in the sea also affect marine animals. And there are many oceans in the world like the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, etc. which are being affected.

    <i><h2><p> How are our actions harming marine wildlife negatively?: Our actions are causing water pollution ocean acidification, we are affecting the growth and health of the biotic components of the marine ecosystems, depletion of coral reefs and marine biodiversity present all over the world and we are overfishing and affecting the marine wild life in a negative way. </p></h2></i>
    <h2><b><i>Why should we protect Oceans and marine life: Oceans host almost 75% of the world's biodiversity, fish provide 20% of animal protein to about three million people, oceans are an important source of food, oceans are carbon sinks and are very beneficial, oceans influence our wellbeing,oceans provide renewable sources of energy for e.g. hydroelectricity, and oceans and other waterbodies are an important part of the water cycle.</i></b></h2>

      <br>
      <p><h2><b><i>How can we save marine life: Help in keeping the beaches clean, reduce your usage of carbon related products, conserve enrgy, be an ocean friendly pet owner, think before you go fishing, support NGOs and other organisation that help keep the ocean clean and protect it, think before throwing something into a water body and promote the need of saving the marine. If someone is doing something bad to the oceans, stop them from doing that.</i></b></h2></p>

      <p><h2><b><i> Why should we act now?: The ocean is one of earths important life support systems, it is essential to protect 30% of the marine by 2030 to prevent the collapse of the earths support system.We need to protect the ocean because it helps in postponing the effect of climate change because it absorbs Co2, we also need to protect the ocean because it stores 80% of the worlds biodiversity and if we protect protect the ocean it will regenarate fast because the ocean has an extra-ordinary capacity to regenrate when it is protected so if we all come together and as one work to protect the ocean nobody can stop us from making the oceans clean and full of life again, so lets come together and work towards protect the the marine because if there is no blue there is no green and it is our job to save the marine.</i></b></h2></p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2><b><i>What have we done till now?:We have protected areas of the marine which is good but it is not enough we need to start protecting our water bodies and marine habitats but if we dont you are aware of the consequences.we have targeted to save 30% of the marine by 2030 but we can't do it alone we need you to support us and contribute in protecting and saving the marine for the good of every single human and animal on this planet</i></b></h2>
