    <h2><P><i>What are we doing to <the ocean?: We are doing mass fishing and harming the marine wild life, for every one pound of fish that goes into the market tens or even hundreds of them are thrown back into the sea.
      <br>
      <br>
    We are using water bodies as dumping grounds and polluting the marine ecosytems and the aquatic habitats without thinking about how it will affect the marine life and even how it might affect us.
    <br>
    <br>

    We are emitting greenhouse gases through many of our daily activities, these green house gases are mostly absorbed by the water bodies and excess absorbtion of these green house gases leads to ocean acidification which affects the health and growth of the marine animals and the biotic components of the marine ecosystem.
    

    <br>
    <br>

    Marine animals (eg- Fish, prawns, crabs, sea urchins, etc.) are losing their homes and because of oil spills, many marine animals aren't able to breath and the fish bones and trash which is also thrown in the sea also affect marine animals. And there are many oceans in the world like the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, etc. which are being affected.

    <i><h2><p>How are our actions harming marine wildlife negatively?: Our actions are causing water pollution ocean acidification, we are affecting the growth and health of the biotic components of the marine ecosystems, depletion of coral reefs and marine biodiversity present all over the world and we are overfishing and affecting the marine wild life in a negative way. </p></h2></i>

    <h2><b><i>Why should we protect Oceans and marine life: Oceans host almost 80% of the world's biodiversity, fish provide 20% of animal protein to about three million people, oceans are an important source of food, oceans are carbon sinks and are very beneficial, oceans influence our wellbeing,oceans provide renewable sources of energy for e.g. hydroelectricity, and oceans and other waterbodies are an important part of the water cycle.</i></b></h2>
